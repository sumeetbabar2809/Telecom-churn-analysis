# Telecom-churn-analysis


# project description
Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription. Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.


# Problem statement
In the telecom field, companies often face a high rate of customer churn (customers leaving the company). It's a big issue as it's easier to retain existing customers than acquire new ones.

The goal in this case is simple:

"We need to figure out which customers might leave us in the future."

Using data about each customer's usage of different services, their account information (how long they've been a customer, their charges), we're going to create a model that predicts which customers are most likely to leave next.

By identifying these customers, the company will be able to target them with special offers or incentives and hopefully prevent them from leaving.
